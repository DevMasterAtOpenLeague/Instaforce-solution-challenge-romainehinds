Solution to the challenge given. 
For Overachiever points I choose to add enlarge image using 3D Touch.

####Challenge
Exercise:
Using the Instagram API, create an iPhone app that displays photos tagged with hashtag #selfie and arranges them using the pattern: big, small, small (repeating). Then implement one of the following features: Tap to enlarge, Drag and drop reordering, or Infinite scrolling. Scrolling should be smooth so performance is essential. Complete as much as you can within one day. Be creative and have fun. Good luck!

####Solution
This project displays images from instagram using the instagram API and implements 3D Touch for enlarging the image.
